grep
grep is used to find specific words, strings or lines of code within files.
Grep takes 2 parameters the first is what you want to search for and the second is the file that you want to search in.
example
grep hello intro.txt

You can also apply grep to the output of another command by piping the result to grep.
example would be
find ~ -name "*.txt" -print | grep README.
here find will find all the .txt file and grep will print only those files with README.
